# KR-Paint
This was a C++ program for my computer science class final. Nothing too fancy.

# Just some things to note:
1) I will likely never work on this again.
2) I designed all the assets myself, except for the font. (Courtesy to some random font site)
3) Don't try to draw too fast while in the program. It's the best I could do with my miniscule understanding of SFML.
4) The "save" feature saves the image to the project folder (in case you're actually interested in this.)
5) If you're not me then it's kinda cool that you looked at this thing, it's also very pointless.
